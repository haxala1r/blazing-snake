# Snake

It's snake, but written in ðŸš€ blazingly fast ðŸš€ ðŸš€ rust ðŸš€, using the ðŸš€ blazingly fast ðŸš€ macroquad crate.

I made this game as part of my conversion to the crab cult. I think I have a fairly good grasp on the
basics now, so yay for that.

Running this project is simple, `cargo run` should just do it. All praise the almighty Crab for
this amazing gift of a build system.

After this simple thingy, I plan on making some more complicated things in Rust. I love it so far,
but I need to learn a bit more... Though I should probably note that making snake in Rust felt a lot
easier than it was in C++. Maybe that's because Rust is a cleaner language overall, or maybe because
SDL2 is a lot messier to use in C++ than macroquad is in Rust. Maybe a bit of both.
